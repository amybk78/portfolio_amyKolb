<h2>Sample Site</h2>
  <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike </a>
<p>The website I linked to is Nike.com. The graphics serve a specific purpose which is to sell the idea that Nike products make us feel good.</p>
<p>The graphics meet the guidlines of "Effective Use of Web Graphics becuase the site uses a white background with very bold colors. The article stated that graphics should provide contrast."</p>
